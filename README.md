# GAM.jl
Julia package for fitting, evaluating, and visualising generalised additive models (GAMs)

## Motivation

[Generalised additive models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_additive_model) (GAMs) are an incredibly powerful modelling tool for regression practitioners. However, the functionality of the excellent R package [`mgcv`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mgcv/mgcv.pdf) is yet to be built in native Julia. This package aims to do just that, albeit at much less complexity given how sophisticated `mgcv` is.

## Development notes

`GAM.jl` is very much a work in progress and is not guaranteed to be functioning at any point yet. Please check back for updates and new features!
